The `fluent-rs` workspace is a collection of Rust crates implementing [Project Fluent][],
a localization system designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language translations.

This crate is a low-level implementation of a collection of localization messages for a single locale.

[Project Fluent]: https://projectfluent.org

Usage
-----

```rust
use fluent_bundle::{FluentBundle, FluentResource};
use icu_locid::langid;

fn main() {
    let ftl_string = "hello-world = Hello, world!".to_owned();
    let res = FluentResource::try_new(ftl_string)
        .expect("Could not parse an FTL string.");

    let langid_en = langid!("en");
    let mut bundle = FluentBundle::new(vec![langid_en]);

    bundle.add_resource(&res)
        .expect("Failed to add FTL resources to the bundle.");

    let msg = bundle.get_message("hello-world")
        .expect("Failed to retrieve a message.");
    let val = msg.value.expect("Message has no value.");

    let mut errors = vec![];
    let value = bundle.format_pattern(val, None, &mut errors);

    assert_eq!(&value, "Hello, world!");
}
```
