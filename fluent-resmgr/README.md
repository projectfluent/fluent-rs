# Fluent Resource Manager

`fluent-resmgr` is an implementation of resource manager for [Project Fluent][].

Resource Manager provides a standalone solution for managing localization resources which
can be used by `fluent-fallback` or other higher level bindings.

Project Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.
The syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand.  At
the same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from
natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.

Usage
-----

```rust
use fluent_resmgr::resource_manager::ResourceManager;

fn main() {
    let mgr = ResourceManager::new("./examples/resources/{locale}/{res_id}".into());

    let bundle = mgr.get_bundle(locales, resources);

    let value = bundle.format_value("hello-world", None);

    assert_eq!(&value, "Hello, world!");
}
```


Status
------

The implementation is in its early stages and supports only some of the Project
Fluent's spec.  Consult the [list of milestones][] for more information about
release planning and scope.

Learn the FTL syntax
--------------------

FTL is a localization file format used for describing translation resources.
FTL stands for _Fluent Translation List_.

FTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent
complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and
others.

    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!

[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax.  If
you're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].
